FantasyBasketballTool
=====================

Tool to simulate a fantasy basketball week

This is in its first working form, and there are still a lot of improvements to be made. 
The todo list is at the top of the FBtool file, and it by nature shows what problems there
still are with the program.

1) BE CAREFUL ABOUT WHAT YOU INPUT
    So far the program will only work correctly if you input 
    the exact string necessary, no mistakes! So follow directions.

2) Percentage categories are approximated, not exact. I didin't take into account
   that a player who plays more days than another in a week will have more sway on the
   total percentage.

3) The program only works on command line right now.

4) The program is only helpful for head-to-head fantasy basketball using the following categories:
    FGM, FG%, FTM, FT%, 3PM, TP%, REB, AST, STL, BLK, TO, DD, PTS
